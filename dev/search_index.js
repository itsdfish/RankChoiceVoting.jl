A voting system that satisfies the monotonicity criterion cannot elect  a different candidate by increasing votes (without otherwise changing the rank order) of a candidate who would otherwise win. In other words, redistributing more votes to the winner (without otherwise changing the rank order), should not prevent the winner from winning. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api_criteria/#RankChoiceVoting.count_violations-Tuple{RankChoiceVoting.Fails, VotingSystem, Monotonicity, Ranks}","page":"Criteria","title":"RankChoiceVoting.count_violations","text":"count_violations(system::VotingSystem, criteria::Monotonicity, rankings::Ranks; n_reps=1000, _...)\n\nCounts the number of violations of the monotonicity criterion for a given voting system.\n\nArguments\n\nsystem::VotingSystem: a voting system object\ncriteria::Monotonicity: condorcet criterion object \nrankings::Ranks: a rank choice voting object consisting of rank counts and unique ranks \n\nKeywords\n\nn_reps=1000: maximum number of Monte Carlo simulations to perform\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api_criteria/#RankChoiceVoting.satisfies-Tuple{RankChoiceVoting.Fails, VotingSystem, Monotonicity, Ranks}","page":"Criteria","title":"RankChoiceVoting.satisfies","text":"satisfies(system::VotingSystem, criteria::Monotonicity, rankings::Ranks; _...)\n\nTests whether a voting system satisfies the monotonicity criterion.\n\nArguments\n\nsystem::VotingSystem: a voting system object\ncriteria::Monotonicity: monotonicity criterion object \nrankings::Ranks: a rank choice voting object consisting of rank counts and unique ranks \n\nKeywords\n\nn_reps=1000: maximum number of Monte Carlo simulations to perform while searching \n\nfor a violation\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api_criteria/#RankChoiceVoting.ReversalSymmetry","page":"Criteria","title":"RankChoiceVoting.ReversalSymmetry","text":"ReversalSymmetry <: Criterion\n\nAn object for the fairness criterion reversal symmetry.

Rank choice voting systems allow voters to order candidates according to preference rather than providing a single selection of the most preferred candidate. Each rank choice voting system specifies a rule for aggregating individual rankings into a societial ranking from which a winner is selected. Importantly, the rules can provide different election outcomes.

The purpose of this package is allow users to explore the conditions under which fairness criteria are satisfied and violated.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In the REPL, type ] to enter package mode and type","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"add RankChoiceVoting","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"to add RankChoiceVoting.jl to your environment.","category":"page"},{"location":"#API-Overview","page":"Home","title":"API Overview","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The API for RankChoiceVoting.jl is summarized below.
