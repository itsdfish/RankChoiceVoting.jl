An instant runoff voting system iteratively eliminates the candidate with the minimum first preferences until one canidate reaches 50% first preferences. According to the reversal systemetry criterion, a winner of an election cannot win if each voter's ranks are reversed.  

Consider a hypothetical rank choice tally in the table below taken from l√¥ (2014). 

| Counts | 4 | 3 | 2 |
|--------|---|---|---|
| First  | a | b | c |
| Second | b | c | a |
| Third  | c | a | b |

In the fist iteration, leading candidate `a` does not have a majority first preference (i.e., 4/9 < .50). In the next, round candidate c is eliminated, yielding

| Counts | 4 | 3 | 2 |
|--------|---|---|---|
| First  | a | b | a |
| Second | b | a | b |

which means candidate `a` now has a majority first preference: 6/9 > .50.
